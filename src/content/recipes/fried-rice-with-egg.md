# Fried Rice with Egg

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 2 cups cooked and chilled rice (preferably day-old)
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots, thawed
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 green onion, thinly sliced (for garnish)
- Optional: 1/2 cup cooked chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu, diced

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat.
2. Pour in the beaten eggs and scramble until fully cooked. Remove them from the pan and set aside.
3. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan.
4. Sauté the onion until translucent and just beginning to brown.
5. Increase the heat to high and add the cooked rice. Stir-fry for a few minutes to heat through.
6. Stir in the peas and carrots, and continue stir-frying for another 2 minutes.
7. Drizzle soy sauce over the rice and mix well.
8. Add the scrambled eggs back into the pan. Mix until the eggs are evenly distributed.
9. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
10. Garnish with sliced green onions before serving.

## Recipe Notes

- For the best results, use day-old rice as it's drier and less sticky, which is ideal for fried rice.
- Feel free to add your choice of protein – cooked chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu can all be diced and added with the vegetables.
- Customize your fried rice with additional vegetables like bell peppers, mushrooms, or bean sprouts if desired.

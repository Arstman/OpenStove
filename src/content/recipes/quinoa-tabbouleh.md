# Quinoa Tabbouleh Recipe

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup quinoa
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh mint, finely chopped
- 1 medium tomato, diced
- 1/2 cucumber, diced
- 2 green onions, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Start by rinsing the quinoa under cold water in a fine-mesh strainer to remove the saponin.
2. In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the quinoa is cooked and the water is absorbed.
3. Fluff the cooked quinoa with a fork and allow it to cool to room temperature.
4. In a large bowl, combine the cooled quinoa, parsley, mint, tomato, cucumber, and green onions.
5. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
6. Pour the dressing over the quinoa mixture and toss until everything is well combined.
7. Adjust the seasonings to your taste, adding more lemon juice, salt, or pepper if needed.
8. Serve the tabbouleh at room temperature or chilled.

## Recipe Notes

- Make sure to rinse the quinoa thoroughly to remove any bitterness.
- The herbs in this dish are key, so use the freshest parsley and mint you can find.
- Lemon juice adds a bright, citrusy flavor to the salad but adjust according to your preference.
- This quinoa tabbouleh can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days, making it a great make-ahead dish.
- To make this dish even more substantial, you can add chickpeas or feta cheese for added protein and flavor.

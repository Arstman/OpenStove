recipeNotes: [
  "Dashi Stock Variation: For a more authentic base, you can use dashi stock combined with the broth for deeper flavor.",
  "Cooking Eggs: For soft-boiled eggs, cook them for 6-7 minutes in boiling water, then place them in ice water. For hard-boiled eggs, cook them for 9-12 minutes.",
  "Vegetarian Option: Substitute the chashu or chicken with tofu and use vegetable broth to make this dish vegetarian.",
  "Gluten-Free Option: Use gluten-free tamari instead of soy sauce, and purchase gluten-free ramen noodles.",
  "Toppings: Feel free to customize your ramen with various toppings like corn, buttered mushrooms, or spinach.",
  "Miso Paste: The ratio of red to white miso can be adjusted to taste; white miso is milder and sweeter, while red miso is stronger and saltier."

recipeNotes:
  [
    "The cake is easier to handle if made a day ahead and chilled overnight.",
    "Some recipes include a layer of jam or cream between cake layers - feel free to experiment.",
    "Use a fork or skewer to hold the cake while dipping to avoid messy fingers.",
    "If the icing becomes too thick, add a little more hot water gradually.",
    "Fresh lamingtons are best, but they can be frozen for up to 3 months.",
    "Pink lamingtons can be made by adding a few drops of red food coloring to the icing."

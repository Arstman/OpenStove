# Traditional French Lemon Tart Recipe

## Ingredients

### For the Pastry Crust:
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, chilled and diced
- 1 large egg yolk

### For the Lemon Filling:
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 large egg yolks
- 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice (about 3-4 lemons)
- 2 tablespoons lemon zest
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

### Prepare the Pastry Crust:
1. In a food processor, combine flour, powdered sugar, and salt.
2. Add the diced butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Add the egg yolk and pulse until the dough starts to come together.
4. Gently press the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
5. Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C).
6. Roll out the dough and press into a 9-inch tart pan. Trim any excess dough from the edges.
7. Line the tart shell with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans.
8. Blind bake for 20-25 minutes until lightly golden.
9. Remove pie weights and parchment paper and let the crust cool.

### Make the Lemon Filling:
1. In a bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, eggs, egg yolks, lemon juice, and lemon zest until well combined.
2. Mix in the melted butter.
3. Pour the filling into the cooled tart shell.
4. Lower the oven temperature to 325째F (165째C) and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set but still slightly wobbly in the center.
5. Let the tart cool completely, then chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving.

## Recipe Notes

- Zest your lemons before juicing them for the most efficient use of the fruit.
- The tart can be made a day in advance and kept chilled, which allows the flavors to meld together.
- For a decorative touch, arrange thinly sliced lemon rounds on top of the tart before baking.
- If the crust edges begin to brown too quickly while baking the tart, protect them with strips of aluminum foil.

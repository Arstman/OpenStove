# Homemade Oat Pancakes with Blueberries Recipe

## Ingredients

- 1 cup oat flour
- 1 tablespoon sugar (optional)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk (any kind)
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for cooking
- 1/2 cup fresh blueberries, plus more for serving
- Maple syrup or honey for serving

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the oat flour, sugar (if using), baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
2. In another bowl, beat the milk, egg, and melted butter until well combined.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix to keep the pancakes tender. The batter should be a little lumpy.
4. Gently fold in the 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries into the batter.
5. Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and brush with a small amount of butter.
6. Pour 1/4 cup measures of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 2-3 minutes per side.
7. Serve the pancakes warm, topped with additional blueberries and a drizzle of maple syrup or honey.

## Recipe Notes

- For an extra nutrition boost, you can add a scoop of your favorite protein powder to the pancake batter.
- These oat pancakes are naturally gluten-free if you're using certified gluten-free oats.
- A pinch of cinnamon or vanilla extract can be added to the batter for an extra layer of flavor.

# Chicken Tagine with Kalamata Olives, Cracked Green Olives, and Preserved Lemons

## Ingredients

- 4 chicken thighs, bone-in and skin-on
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted
- 1/2 cup cracked green olives, pitted
- 1/4 cup preserved lemon peel, thinly sliced
- Fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine the cumin, coriander, paprika, ginger, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken thighs and coat them with the spice mixture.
2. In a tagine pot or heavy-bottomed pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken and brown on both sides. Remove the chicken and set aside.
3. In the same pot, add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and sauté the onions and garlic until soft and translucent.
4. Return the chicken to the pot and add the chicken stock. Cover and simmer on low heat for about 40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
5. Add the Kalamata olives, cracked green olives, and preserved lemons to the pot. Cover and simmer for an additional 10 minutes.
6. Check seasoning and adjust if necessary. Garnish with chopped cilantro or parsley before serving.

## Recipe Notes

- Marinating the chicken for several hours or overnight will intensify the flavors.
- Be careful with salt as olives and preserved lemons are already salty.
- For an authentic touch, garnish the dish with fresh herbs and serve it directly from the tagine pot.
- Chicken tagine can be made ahead of time; in fact, it tastes even better the next day as the flavors meld.
